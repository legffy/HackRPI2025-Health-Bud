Health Bud

Developers: Ryan Wang, Randy Taylor, and Ethan Guo

Overview:
A retro RPG-style health companion that gives personalized advice and real-world care recommendations.

Functionality:

Health Bud acts as an interactive, RPG-style health companion that responds to user questions, analyzes personal health stats, and recommends real-world care options. Users input basic information—such as name, age, weight, height, diet, and goals—and the system computes derived metrics like BMI, calorie targets, water intake, energy level, and sleep range. When a user asks a question, Health Bud uses Gemini to generate concise, personalized wellness advice presented through a retro typewriter-style dialogue system with animated pixel-art expressions. The backend also classifies the user’s concerns into categories such as injury rehab, heart issues, mental health, or nutrition, and then queries the Google Places API to provide relevant nearby locations like clinics, gyms, therapists, or urgent care centers. The interface supports turn-based Q&A navigation, audio cues, and a stable two-panel layout that keeps Bud on screen while showing the user’s stats and recommendations.
